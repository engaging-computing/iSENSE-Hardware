    <!-- SyncTime -->
    <string name="syncTime">Synchronizing time is useful when using multiple devices to record data at the
	    same time.  By default, many Android devices\' clocks will not match one
	    another\'s, thus making recording data at similar times difficult.  However,
	    you have a choice to fix this issue by setting a device as a \"host\".
	    This can be done by hitting the \"Send\" button.  Upon hitting \"Send\", 
	    the time from that particular Android device will be broadcasted as a \"timeframe\"
	    that all other phones in the local network can receive.  However, in order for
	    a phone to receive a broadcasted time, that phone must be currently in 
	    receive-mode, which can be done by hitting \"Receive\".  In other words, if
	    you intend on receiving a host\'s time, you must be in receive-mode before the
	    host hits \"Send\". (By default, \"Send\" will also receive the time that you have 
	    broadcasted, should you be the host).  After pressing either \"Send\" or 
	    \"Receive\", a dialog box will tell you the time that has been received from
	    the host, along with the millisecond offset between
	    the received time and your Android device\'s actual clock.  If you do choose 
	    to synchronize time, recording data will now work off of the host\'s timeframe.
	    This now allows for simultaneous data recording across multiple devices at the 
	    same time.  Please note: synchronizing time will only work if all the Android
	    devices are connected to the same WiFi network.  Mobile plans (e.g. 3G or 4G)
	    generally will not allow for synchronizing time.  Also, synchronizing time may not be
	    allowed on some WiFi networks, but it generally works on small, password-secured 
	    WiFi networks.  Should you want to revert to your phone\'s local timestamp, you
	    can use the \"Reset\" button.</string>
