			      SUMMARY

Please prepend each .apk file with "beta_" and append it with "_vX_X".
For example, if we were testing the Uploader app on version 3.2, we
would call the .apk file
      beta_uploader_v3_2.apk

Add all .apk files to be tested to the "Tests" directory and
list your file to be tested in this .txt file.

IF YOUR APP IS NOT LISTED HERE, IT WILL NOT BE TESTED.

Also, write a short description of what testers should be looking for
with your update.

After testing any application listed here, please leave your name and
a brief response as to how the app test went in the comments section
